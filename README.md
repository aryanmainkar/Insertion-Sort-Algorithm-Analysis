# Insertion Sort Algorithm Runtime Analysis
<h2 style = "font-size : 18px";>Introduction </h2><ul><li> This program is a C implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm. It reads integer values from an input file and sorts them in ascending order using the Insertion Sort algorithm. The sorted values are then printed to the console. The purpose of this program is to demonstrate the performance of the Insertion Sort algorithm for varying input sizes.</li></ul>

<h2 style = "font-size : 18px";> Description</h2><ul><li>The program was writen to implement the Insertion Sort algorithm in C and measure its performance for various input sizes. The program reads input values from a file and sorts them in ascending order using the Insertion Sort algorithm. The sorted values are then printed to the console. The program is designed to measure the running time of the algorithm for various input sizes. </li></ul>

<h2 style = "font-size : 18px";>Code Overview </h2><ul><li>The program is written in C and consists of several functions. The main function is responsible for calling the other functions and measuring the running time of the algorithm. The other functions are responsible for reading the input values, sorting the values using the Insertion Sort algorithm, and printing the sorted values to the console. </li></ul>

<h3 style = "font-size : 16px">Readfileintoarray Function </h3><ul><li>
The readfileintoarray function reads the input values from a file and stores them in an array. The function takes three parameters: the number of command line arguments (argc), an array of command line arguments (argv), and a pointer to an integer array (Arr). The function returns the number of values read from the input file. The function first opens the input file for reading and determines the number of values in the file. It then allocates memory for the integer array based on the number of values in the file. Finally, the function reads the values from the file and stores them in the integer array.</li></ul>

<h3 style = "font-size : 16px">InsertionSort Function</h3><ul><li>
The insertionSort function implements the Insertion Sort algorithm to sort the input values in ascending order. The function takes two parameters: an integer array (Arr) and the number of elements in the array (Elements). The function iterates over the array and inserts each element in its correct position in the sorted subarray. The function uses a key element to compare with the elements in the sorted subarray and shifts elements to the right to make space for the key element. The function repeats this process until all elements have been inserted into the sorted subarray.</li></ul>

<h3 style = "font-size : 16px">PrintArray Function</h3><ul><li>The PrintArray function prints the elements of an integer array to the console. The function takes two parameters: an integer array (Arr) and the number of elements in the array (SizeAp). The function iterates over the array and prints each element to the console.</li></ul>

<h3 style = "font-size : 18px";>Main Function </h3><ul><li>The main function is responsible for calling the other functions and measuring the running time of the algorithm. The function takes two parameters: the number of command line arguments (argc) and an array of command line arguments (argv). The function first calls the readfileintoarray function to read the input values from the input file and store them in an integer array. The function then calls the insertionSort function to sort the values in ascending order. The function measures the running time of the algorithm using the clock function. The sorted values are then printed to the console using the PrintArray function. </li></ul>
